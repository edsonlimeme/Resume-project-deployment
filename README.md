# Edson Limeme ‚Äì Serverless Resume Website

This project is a fully serverless resume website using:

- üñ•Ô∏è S3 for static hosting
- üß† Lambda (Python) for contact form
- üåê API Gateway for HTTP trigger
- üõ†Ô∏è Terraform for infrastructure
- ü§ñ GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## üîó Live Links

- Resume Site: http://edson-resume-site-demo.s3-website.af-south-1.amazonaws.com
- Contact API:

## üìù Contact Handler

## Deployment Journey and Troubleshooting

During the deployment process, several challenges were encountered and resolved:

1. **Resource Naming and Terraform Configuration Issues**  
   - Initial errors due to referencing undeclared Terraform resources and missing input variables like `aws_region`.  
   - Fixed by properly declaring variables and using correct resource references.

2. **Bucket Policy and Public Access Settings**  
   - AWS S3 blocks public policies by default, which prevented setting bucket policies.  
   - Resolved by disabling the `BlockPublicPolicy` setting via `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` resource and applying a bucket policy to allow public read access.

3. **Bucket Already Exists Error**  
   - Terraform plan failed because the bucket `edson-resume-site-demo` already existed and was owned by the user.  
   - Resolved by importing the existing bucket into Terraform state using:  
     ```bash
     terraform import aws_s3_bucket.resume_site edson-resume-site-demo
     ```

4. **Incorrect Website Endpoint URL**  
   - The initially used URL for accessing the website was incorrect, causing DNS errors.  
   - Fixed by using the correct S3 website endpoint format:  
     ```
     http://edson-resume-site-demo.s3-website.af-south-1.amazonaws.com
     ```

## Accessing the Website

Your resume website is now live and accessible at: http://edson-resume-site-demo.s3-website.af-south-1.amazonaws.com

## Terraform Files Structure

- `main.tf`  
  Defines AWS provider, creates S3 bucket, bucket policy, public access block, website configuration, and uploads static files (`index.html`, `style.css`).

- `variables.tf`  
  Declares input variables such as `aws_region` and `bucket_name`.

- `outputs.tf`  
  Outputs the website URL after deployment.

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`  
  GitHub Actions workflow automating Terraform init, plan, and apply on pushes to the `main` branch.

---

## How to Deploy

1. **Set up AWS credentials**  
   - Add your AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) as secrets in your GitHub repository.

2. **Push code to GitHub**  
   - On push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically run Terraform commands to deploy your infrastructure.

3. **Monitor workflow**  
   - Check GitHub Actions tab to monitor deployment progress and logs.

4. **Visit your website**  
   - Use the output URL to view your deployed resume site.

## Future Improvements

- Add a custom domain with SSL support using AWS CloudFront and Route 53.
- Add automatic cache invalidation on CloudFront after updates.
- Implement Terraform plan review in CI before apply.
- Automate HTTPS redirection.
